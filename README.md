# dob-python-blender-gears-addon
An addon for Blender, to draw internal and spur gears

There are two files:

The file spurgears.py is used to draw an ordinary spur gear, while internalgears.py is used to draw an internal gear.

To use these files:
1 - Go into Blender (I'm using Blender 2.8), you might want to delete the cube that greets you when you open the program.
2 - Drag from the top-right corner of the main workspace, to create another workspace, and then click on the dropdown on the top-left, then select Text Editor.
3 - Click on Open (located at top centre of the Text Editor workspace), and then pick the Python files where you saved them.
4 - To run it, click on Run Script, at the top right of the Text Editor workspace.
